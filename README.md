On the journey of 1000 projects challenge. Starting from 5th Novemember,2022 my goal is to make 1000 projects related to frontend and backend web development as well as other programming languages. I have intended to make projects using languages like HTML, CSS , JS, React, Nodejs, Django and Java.

I have decided to start this journey to make myself to keep learning and growing everyday. Completing 1000 projects is very hard to complete and it takes longer time as well as harder work that will help me to keep me engage with learnig and doing somthing. Through this journey i will be learning from different platform like youtube, udemy, google and many more other sites. I will be doing guided projects from different authors and teachers and aimed to do at least 100projects of my own.

Though it may take more than a years to complete, i am intended to complete this huge challenges at any cost.
